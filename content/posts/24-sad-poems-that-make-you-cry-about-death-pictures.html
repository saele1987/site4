    <h3>I&#039;m unbelievably sad and regretful that i was unable to help her.</h3>
    <p>Leaving no genre untouched, these sad songs that make you cry range from the beatles to eric clapton to pearl jam toâ€¦well you&#039;ll have to originally recorded by prince, this is one of those songs that will make you cry, as it&#039;s all about how, while life does go on after love, it kind of really sucks. The familiar stranger you passed by and i smiled looking at you, you saw me and acted as though you hadn&#039;t, that was something new i called out your name, hoping you&#039;d hear, you picked up pace, not out of urgency but out of fear.

The bad season makes the poet sad new sad poems.</p>
