    <h3>Life is eternal, and love is immortal, and death is only a horizon;</h3>
    <p>If the people we love rnare stolen from us, the way to have them live on is to never rnstop loving them. This poem is about young picking up his father&#039;s dry cleaning after his unexpected death and donating his clothes to goodwill; I loved the last section of this book, and found myself returning to poems again and again. When we lose something that is precious to us, we are left with a feeling of sadness.</p>
