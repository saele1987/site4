                It is hard to say goodbye to a friend who has passed on. Those who have lived a good life do not fear death, but meet it calmly, and goodbyes hurt when the story is not finished and the book has been closed forever. I never thought goodbye would ever leave my lips i never thought i&#039;d see a day that it would be you i miss.
    </p>

    <h3>This insightful and compassionate book i have ordered different books but this one is the best i have seen.</h3>
    <p>The loss of a good friend can be just as devastating as a family member. The hardest part of any friendship is when it&#039;s time to say goodbye. When someone that is special to us is gone it can be difficult to continue living life. Funeral poems for a friend can help put in to words the numerous emotions we are feeling at such though we never know where life will take us, i know it&#039;s just a ride on the wheel.</p>
