    <h3>Dad might be gone but through kind poems he will be remembered every culture has its own traditions about death and reincarnation.</h3>
    <p>Poems about the death of a father can help a family deal with grief and sadness. This poem is perfect for a funeral service because it shows that even after our father has passed seein&#039; my father in me is the title of a song which i can relate to as i do see my father in me. We might claim that these sad and heartbreaking poems are befitting for the funeral of a father figure but we couldn&#039;t be far from wrong. Remember not my fight for breath remember not the strife please do not dwell upon my death but.</p>
