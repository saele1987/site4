    <h3>This is the last known portrait of the poet.</h3>
    <p>John keats was born in london on 31 october 1795, the eldest of thomas and frances jennings keats&#039;s four children. A voracious reader at enfield academy, he developed a close association with the headmaster of the school. At the time of his death itself, he had only been writing poetry for about six years, and had only published three volumes of poetry. *(book 3) keats sings about apollo (thinking of tom&#039;s premature death, he feels he should turn rather than wallow in his death).</p>
