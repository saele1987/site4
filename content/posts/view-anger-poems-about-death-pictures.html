                One, pale as yonder waning moon with lips of lurid blue; Ignorance and fear of death overshadow life, while knowing. And scars of her past, hidden under her clothes, are a roadmap to places, that nobody knows.
    </p>

    <h3>They can be shared with others who are also suffering as they express words and feelings that are sometimes difficult to express on your own.</h3>
    <p>Poems about anger and pain. Anger you hope to never receive, anger stays forever within. If i could write anger into poetry i&#039;d write about how five months with someone has led me to almost 6 months of insanity. Ignorance and fear of death overshadow life, while knowing.</p>
